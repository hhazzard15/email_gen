    <p>Good {time} and thank you for contacting Premier Pools & Spas. If you have time, I would love to schedule a call with you and see how I can help you with any pool questions and help you design a free 3D dream pool. I have provided a link below to a video so you can get an idea of what pool features cost. <br><br>

        There are many factors to consider when selecting a company to build your pool and I want to highlight a few.<br><br>
        Premier Pools & Spas is distinguished from other pool builders in that:<br><br>
        - We have been in business since 1988 and built over 60,000 pools as a company<br><br>
        - We are the #1 pool builder in the nation in both size and customer satisfaction<br><br>
        - We create custom 3D Virtual Tour designs (rendered to scale) for you at NO COST<br><br>
        - PPAS uses larger plumbing than the industry standard which facilitates increased water flow, lowers overall costs, less maintenance, and less wear on the equipment<br><br>
        - PPAS uses heavier gauge steel around the bond beam and a superior basket design which increases the overall strength by 100% compared to the industry standard. Therefore, we can warranty your pool FOR LIFE!<br><br>
        Please take some time to explore our website: www.ppas.com. You can view hundreds of the pools we have built and read up on our company history.<br><br>
        I am looking forward to speaking with you and designing your dream backyard.</p>
